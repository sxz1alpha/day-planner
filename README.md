# Day Planner

This is a simple day planner for busy professionals. There are time blocks for regular buisness hours that dynamically change color
to reflect weather that block is in the past, present or future. As a military veteran i elected to make the planner on military time.
When a user clicks the save button the page backs up the input field to local storage. 

The deployed application can be found here:
